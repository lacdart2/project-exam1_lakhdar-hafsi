![screenshot of project exam 1 homepage](images/frame-spacex.png)
this project was about implementing use of javascript and api in fetching external data , we were requested to chose between either nasa api website topic or spacex topic.

## Description

this project was a good implementation of use of javascrip and api calls, i fetched a lot of data from spacex api open source websites with no need for identifications of keys.
this website is a spacex community website, where users could gather to get information about rockets, launches, next launches and past of space x space rocket company.

- a general view about the company feel and look and purpose
- presentation of space x fleet throw data and images
- timeline of development of space x throw time since 2002
- past of future launches of space x with details regarding the rocket type and mission date and payload and so on
  i took in consideration that this could be a place for passionate space rocket, space exploration , planetary exploration enthusiasts, rockets and science students or fans

- im a huge fan of space x, astronomy and planetary exploration, so it was easy and obvious to put myself as a typical user .
- as a user i would like to get the feel of the website, i made a welcoming, planetary-earth approach bakcground image with animations that could a good sensation for a new user.
- as a user i would like to see spacex rockets , so i gathered all in a slider, with fetched data for different api urls.
- as a user i would like to see the next and previous launches, so all is presented in slider, for past i limited the number, otherwise this could be overwhelming.
- a timer for next launch gives more excitement .

- as a user i would like to check the website from different devices, this website is responsive.
- a login form and creating account form and recovery password form are available.
- i used little colors that matches the purpose and use of the website.
